<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I worked at Dunkin’ Donuts for nearly five years - from my first job in high school at age 17 to graduating college at age 22. Dunkin’ provided my first glimpse at the working world, introduced me to great friends, helped pay my college tuition, and fueled an unyielding caffeine addiction.</p>
<p>Even after leaving Dunkin’ in pursuits of becoming a data scientist, I’m still a loyal customer and love keeping tabs on what’s new with the brand.
So for my first blog post, I want to explore what data-driven insights might be gathered about Dunkin’ using only publicly available data (i.e. web scraping, API’s, and financial documentation).</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-find-my-dunkin-data" class="section level3">
<h3>How do I find my Dunkin’ Data?</h3>
<p>Dunkin’ Donuts has a Mobile App</a> for on-the-go ordering that lists all available stores in a user’s area based on zip code. My hope was that I might be able to connect to the web API underpinning this app and collect data on store locations in the United States.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was the case and I wasn’t even the first person to try this out! I came across a blog post titled <a href = "https://www.isaacslavitt.com/posts/dunkin-donuts-data-analysis/" target = "_blank">“Analyzing Dunkin’ Donuts’ business with scraped data”</a> by Isaac Slavitt (Jan 8, 2014). Seven years ago, Issac had essentially the same goal as mine. He collected data from the MAPQuest API that underpins Dunkin’s store locator, explored the data with Python, and visualized some interesting results.</p>
<p>I’m going to mirror Issac’s approach, but my post utilizes the R programming language, asks several different questions, and has the luxury of seeing how things have changed in terms of Dunkin’s data reporting since 2014.</p>
</div>
<div id="connecting-to-the-mapquest-api" class="section level3">
<h3>Connecting to the MapQuest API</h3>
<p>The <a href = "https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/search-api/v2/" target = "_blank">MapQuest API</a> provides up to 4000 records of location data and auxiliary information in a single GET request. Data can be in either JSON or XML format based on the “outputFormat” parameter.</p>
<p>All U.S. Dunkin’ store records were combined into a single dataframe by looping a series of eight GET requests together based on different bounding boxes. Each bounding box was optimized to corresponded with roughly 4000 records to complete the dataset with the fewest number of iterations. The httr, jsonlite, and dplyr packages were all used in the data wrangling process and can be viewed by clicking on the “Code” button or visiting my GitHub repo.</p>

<p>Columns 2 through 11 each contain information with varying levels of geographic granularity (ex. <em><i>address</i></em>, <em><i>city</i></em>, <em><i>state</i></em>, <em><i>county</i></em>, etc.)</p>
<p>Columns 12 through 18 list the stores hours for each day of the week by location. Stores open all day are coded as “24HOURS”.</p>
<p>Column 14 (<em><i>sitetype</i></em>) lists the two-character site designations, which can be partially decoded by analyzing similarities in records with the same site type. For instance, “DT” appears to represent stores in Amusement Parks:</p>
<pre><code>##   recordid                  address       address2         city state

<p>Apparently, there are also Dunkin’ locations inside of Home Depots. So here are the “HI” sitetypes that you can visit to purchase home repair tools and Jelly Munchkins at the same time:</p>
<pre><code>##   recordid              address   address2      city state
## 1   339773          575 Bank St Home Depot Waterbury    CT
## 2   346683 2445 Springfield Ave Home Depot  Vauxhall    NJ

## 4   339762      1149 Hingham St Home Depot  Rockland    MA</code></pre>
<p>Dunkin’ has also found a way to infiltrate their way into the highest ranks of the U.S. government by meeting the coffee demands of those in the House of Representatives, State Department, Pentagon, and more. There is actually something weirdly democratic about this fact that I enjoy. The Dunkin’ coffee that I drink is essentially the same for everyone - whether you are U.S. Representative, Naval Officer, or a humble data analyst.</p>
<pre><code>##   recordid                 address2       city state
## 1   355122        Navel Air Station   Coronado    CA
## 2   355099 House of Representatives Washington    DC

<p>There are a total of 27 different sitetypes, but here are a few more I feel pretty confident about:</p>

<p>Column 15 lists the <em><i>pos_type</i></em>. These are names of “Point of Sale” technologies (cash registers) deployed at each location.</p>
<p>Column 16 provides any co-brand codes (<em><i>co_brander_cd</i></em>) associated with the store.</p>
<p>Column 17 states the operation status code (<em><i>operation_status_cd</i></em>), but I cant decipher what the values mean. Apparently, 8,919 stores are code “7”, 172 stores are “3”, and another are 147 are “2”.</p>
<p>Column 18 contains the <a href = "https://help-ooyala.brightcove.com/sites/all/libraries/dita/en/video-platform/reference/dma_codes.html" target = "_blank">Nielsen Designated Market Area (DMA) codes</a> (<em><i>dma_cd</i></em>). These are the codes provided by the Neilsen Corporation - a media marketing firm that specializes in measuring TV audience statistics. Dunkin appears to list these codes to better stratify store locations based on marketing efforts conducted in each area.</p>
<p>Column 19 (<em><i>close_reason_cd</i></em>) probably contains short-term codes relating to store closure, but it’s hard to tell because the entire column is just empty / missing data.</p>
<p>Column 20 (<em><i>otg_menu_opt</i></em>) is somewhat interesting in that it lists whether stores use the regular menu options “RM” established by the franchise or another “EP” / “E” option. I think “EP” and “E” are identical because these records only list locations inside airports. (Ex: Midway Int’L Airport, JFK Intl Airport, Dallas Love Field Airport)</p>
<p>Columns 21 through 45 are all binary (“Y”,“N”) variables to indicate whether each store has a certain service or amenity like K-Cups, Almond Milk, Mobile Pay, and Curbside Pick-up.</p>

<h3>An Additional Piece of Outside Data</h3>
<p>I added on an additional column designating each store’s regional district as disclosed by Dunkin’s FTC <a href = "https://www.bluemaumau.org/sites/default/files/DD_FDD%20UFOC%2003-26-10%20AMND%2011-23-10.pdf" target = "_blank">Franchise Disclosure Agreements</a>. According to Dunkin’, they have eight regional districts:</p>

<h3>Which Dunkin’ Donuts are located clostest to each other?</h3>
<p>Having grown up in New Jersey, seeing a Dunkin’ Donuts on virtually every block was an expected sight. I always wondered which Dunkin’ locations were located closest to each other because I imagined they would be comically close - like having two locations literally adjacent to one another.</p>
<p>There have been posts like this on social media that have sprung up over the years. For instance, here is a <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/6pqbr7/these_two_dunkin_donuts_next_to_each_other_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3" target = "_blank">Reddit post</a> literally showing me that what I imagined is an actual reality:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecypher/ecypher.github.io/master/images/Dunkin_Reddit_Pic.jpg" width="40%" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can’t count situations like what we see in this Reddit post. That’s because (1) I don’t know if both these locations are still operational in 2021 and (2) this may be a temporarily situation where one franchise owner is moving store locations so both Dunkin’ Donuts don’t actually operate simultaneously.</p>
<p>To calculate which locations are closest, I’m going to construct a dissimilarity matrix (a matrix that measures each location relative to every other point in my dataframe) and perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering.</p>

<u>Please Note:</u><br>
I use the terms <i>Dunkin’</i>, <i> Dunkin’ Donuts</i>, and <i>Dunkin’ Brands</i> interchangeably although there are actually differences between the three. When I first worked at the franchise, the stores were called <i> Dunkin’ Donuts</i>. In September 2018, however, <a href = "https://www.delish.com/food-news/a23494352/dunkin-donuts-ceo-reasons-for-name-change/" target = "_blank">the name was shortened to just Dunkin’</a> for brand imaging. <i>Dunkin’ Brands</i> is the American restaurant holding company that runs both <i>Dunkin Donuts</i> and Baskin-Robbins. More recently in October 2020, <a href = "https://stories.inspirebrands.com/inspire-completes-acquisition-dunkin-donuts-baskin-robbins/" target = "_blank">Dunkin’ Brands was acquired by privately-owned Inspire Brands, Inc</a> for $11.3 billion.
